# CPSC301 - Assignment 1

## Part 1 
Create a main program that asks a user to enter one single word. The program then counts how many vowels and consonants are in the word and outputs each total to the console.

**NOTE:** Vowels are A, E, I, O, U and the rest are consonants.

#### Ex 1:
**Please enter a word:** onomatopoeia<br/>
**Vowels:** 8<br/>
**Consonants:** 4<br/>

## Part 2
Create a main program that asks a user for 2 string inputs. The program then compares the two strings one letter at a time to see if the words are the same. **DO NOT** use if (str1 == str2). That solution will not receive points.

#### Ex 1:
**Please enter word number 1:** mystring<br/>
**Please enter word number 2:** mystring<br/>
**mystring and mystring are a match!**<br/>

#### Ex 2:
**Please enter word number 1:** car<br/>
**Please enter word number 2:** show<br/>
**car and show are not a match!**<br/>

## Additional Instructions
* **DO NOT** use using namespace std at the top of your main.cpp file for either program. For instance, use std::cout << “...” << std::endl;
* Name the file in part 1 main1.cpp and show it to the instructor for credit.
* Name the file in part 2 main2.cpp and show it to the instructor for credit.
* Submit the Github link on Titanium in the assignment window.
